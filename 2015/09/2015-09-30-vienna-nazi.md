This [terrible article](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/09/30/world/europe/rise-of-austrian-right-lengthens-shadow-of-nazi-era.html?smid=fb-share&_r=1&referer=http://m.facebook.com) makes a caricature of Vienna and the Austrian people and its author should be ashamed of herself.

Despite all the beauty and majesty of this city, she adheres to Godwin’s law by effectively saying Vienna is heading back to olden times of the Reich because people aren’t sure what to think about a huge refugee crisis that no country knows how to handle.  

It’s such a lazy, overused tactic which simplifies so much about contemporary Vienna. And to the political point, there is a huge glorification of the social democratic party which makes no sense to anyone who actually lives here.  

But what can you expect from an author who rather than jets in for a few days, stays in a hotel in the first district, and meets city elites who write the script for her?  

Anything that is not a left-wing, statist party = Nazi, is what she says. Shameful.

“Newspaper of record,” they say.

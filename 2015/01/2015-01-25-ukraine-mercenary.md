Is this American (or Anglo) mercenary in Marioupol, Ukraine fighting the Russian-backed separatists? Or protecting the Ukrainian state forces? Who hired him? [Is he Blackwater](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2576490/Are-Blackwater-active-Ukraine-Videos-spark-talk-U-S-mercenary-outfit-deployed-Donetsk.html)?

The Russians say one thing, the Ukrainians another, and so many people don’t know what to think.

Whether it’s Putin, the EU, Cameron, or Obama, [I agree with Adam Curtis](http://l.yael.ca/8F): This “strategy of creating confusing and contradictory political and media narratives” makes it habitually impossible for any reasonable person to be informed about the world.

Perhaps they want it that way.

# Bonjour


Bonjour.

My name is Yaël Ossowski.

I’m a consumer and technology advocate, writer, and podcaster based between Vienna, Austria and North Carolina.

I’m Deputy Director at the <a href="https://consumerchoicecenter.org/team/yael-ossowski/">Consumer Choice Center</a>, and a contributor to newspapers, magazines, and online outlets on issues of technological innovation, lifestyle freedom, and smart policy. And <a href="https://yael.ca/?s=bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>.

I co-host the Consumer Choice Podcast, post various interviews and videos of mine on my YouTube channel, and I’m a collaborator and co-host on the Fix The Money podcast and Substack.

Since 2023, I’m a Visiting Fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, where I’m hosting much of my research and writing on state-level public policy on Bitcoin.

Previously, I was an investigative reporter at Watchdog.org, serving as Florida Bureau Chief and chief Spanish translator. From 2013-2020, I worked as a grassroots organizer and fundraiser for Students For Liberty, primarily in Europe and the United States, but also on 3 other continents.

I have written and been syndicated in hundreds of publications globally, including USA Today, the Boston Herald, Chicago Tribune, Miami Herald, La Presse, Le Journal de Montréal, Austin American-Statesman, Washington Examiner, Huffington Post, The Charlotte Observer, Arizona Capitol Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer, Detroit News, Reason Magazine, American Spectator, The Gaston Gazette, FoxNews.com, and much more. A full list can be found here.

Since 2011, I’ve been a member of the Society of Professional Journalists and I studied Political Science and History at Concordia University in Montréal and the University of Vienna. I received a Master’s Degree in Philosophy, Politics, Economics at CEVRO in Prague, Czech Republic.

Je suis né au Québec, raised in the American south, and spend most of my days in Central Europe.

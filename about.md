# Bonjour.

My name is Yaël Ossowski.

I’m a consumer and technology advocate, journlist, and writer.

I’m Deputy Director at the <a href="https://consumerchoicecenter.org/team/yael-ossowski/">Consumer Choice Center</a>, and a contributor to newspapers, magazines, and online outlets on issues of technological innovation, lifestyle freedom, and smart policy. And <a href="https://yael.ca/?s=bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>.

I co-host the <a href="https://omny.fm/shows/consumerchoiceradio">Consumer Choice Podcast</a>, post various interviews and videos of mine on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@yaeloss">YouTube channel</a>, and I’m a collaborator and co-host on the <a href="https://www.fixthemoney.net/">Fix The Money</a> podcast and Substack.

Since 2023, I’m a Visiting Fellow at the <a href="https://www.btcpolicy.org/authors/yael-ossowski">Bitcoin Policy Institute</a>, where I’m hosting much of my research and writing on state-level public policy on Bitcoin.

Previously, I was an investigative reporter at <a href="https://yael.ca/category/watchdog-org/">Watchdog.org</a>, serving as Florida Bureau Chief and chief Spanish translator. From 2013-2020, I worked as a grassroots organizer and fundraiser for Students For Liberty, primarily in Europe and the United States, but also on 3 other continents.

I have written and been syndicated in hundreds of publications globally, including USA Today, the Boston Herald, Chicago Tribune, Miami Herald, La Presse, Le Journal de Montréal, Austin American-Statesman, Washington Examiner, Huffington Post, The Charlotte Observer, Arizona Capitol Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer, Detroit News, Reason Magazine, American Spectator, The Gaston Gazette, FoxNews.com, and much more. A full list can be <a href="https://yael.ca/writings/">found here</a>.

Since 2011, I’ve been a member of the Society of Professional Journalists and I studied Political Science and History at Concordia University in Montréal and the University of Vienna. I received a Master’s Degree in Philosophy, Politics, Economics at CEVRO in Prague, Czech Republic.

Je suis né au Québec, raised in the American south, and spend most of my days in Central Europe and Washington, D.C.

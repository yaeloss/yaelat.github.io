This is my short bio website, hosted here on GitHub. 

I'm still aiming to hope my 1000+ article archive over my journalistic and policy career, but I'm having trouble finding an appropriate (and functioning) XML->Markdown converter for a large file size.

In the meantime, those articles are over on <a href="https://yael.ca">Yael.ca</a>.
